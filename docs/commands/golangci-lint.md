# golangci-lint

```sh
vmatch golangci-lint # followed by any args you would give to golangci-lint
```

This command is not meant to be used directly, but rather through `~/.vmatch/bin/golangci-lint` which should be the `golangci-lint` in your PATH. Whether this is the case can be verified with [`vmatch doctor`](./doctor.md)
